# BASELINE
Ho, the only thing you gotta know
My dick touch the ground when I'm sitting on the flo'
You think I'm gonna fall off? I got advice for ya homes
Fall asleep in your car in your garage with the engine on
I'm playing ping pong with your bitch' jaws
You the type to have a sing-along in Superman drawers
I got a redhead ho, I call her Molly Ringwald
She like to take a lot of Molly and bring Adderall
Sipping white wine 'til the sunset
Before it got dark she already got naked
Necked her for a second, then she got reckless
Rump shaker, wrecks and FX'd it
Bum, stickity bum, stickity bum, Das EFX'ed it
Left her bum sticky, fell asleep on the terrace
Me on the beat, that's a hate crime
With black ink, I murder white lines
